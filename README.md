Hi everyone, 

this is one of my first website I ever done, actually I did it some month ago, 
but the dising was quite awful. So now, that I'm more confy with my developer 
skills I decied to restart the project. 

In this project I focused on the dising and UI/UX, trying to do it clean and 
keep it simple, the JS is just a 100 lines quite simple, just a AJAX call every
time the user search, and using some JS and Jquery.

So the main point was to improve my desing skills.
